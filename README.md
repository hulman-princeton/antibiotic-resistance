# Antibiotic Resistance Simulation
This repository contains the code and results from my final project for EEB 325: Mathematical Modeling in Biology and Medicine (Princeton University, Fall 2023).

## Abstract
We simulate the amount of susceptible (S) and resistant (R) bacteria over time with varied starting parameters using differential equations.
